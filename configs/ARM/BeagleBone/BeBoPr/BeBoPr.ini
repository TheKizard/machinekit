# Step timing is 40 us steplen + 40 us stepspace
# That gives 80 us step period = 12.5 KHz step freq
#
# Bah, even software stepping can handle that, hm2 doesnt buy you much with
# such slow steppers.
#
# Scale is 200 steps/rev * 5 revs/inch = 1000 steps/inch
#
# This gives a maxvel of 12.5/1 = 12.5 ips
#

# Steps/mm numbers are set for a standard Kossel:
# http://reprap.org/wiki/Kossel
# Using:
#  16-tooth GT2 belt
#  200 steps/rev motors
#  16x microstepping
# Yields 100 steps/mm.
#
# 2mm/tooth * 16 tooth/rev = 32mm/rev
# (16*200 steps / rev) * (1 rev / 32mm) =  100 steps/mm
#
# Positive 'scale' causes counter-clockwise motion when looking at the shaft,
# when the plug is connected with the exposed pin bits facing outwards
# (with red wire nearer to the switches side of the board).
#
# To have the carriage home with up motion, we set 'scale' negative.
# Then, a positive axis motion moves the carriage up.
#
# Example max step rates:
# 100 mm/s * 100 steps/mm = 10K steps/sec
# 500 mm/s * 100 setps/mm = 50K steps/sec
